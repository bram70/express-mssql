    <documentation>The BreadCrumbs control represents the navigation steps up to the current location in the application and allows
the user to quickly navigate to a previous location on the path that got him to the current location.
It has two main modes of operation. One is a trail of links followed by separators (when there's enough space
for the control to fit on one line), and the other is a dropdown list with the links (when the trail of links
wouldn't fit on one line).</documentation>
