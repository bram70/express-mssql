            <documentation>The key of the data in this CustomData object.
When the data is just stored, it can be any string, but when it is to be written to HTML (writeToDom == true) then it must also be a valid HTML attribute name (it must conform to the sap.ui.core.ID type and may contain no colon) to avoid collisions, it also may not start with &quot;sap-ui&quot;. When written to HTML, the key is prefixed with &quot;data-&quot;.
If any restriction is violated, a warning will be logged and nothing will be written to the DOM.</documentation>

        <property group="Data" type="sap.ui.core/any" name="value">
            <documentation>The data stored in this CustomData object.
When the data is just stored, it can be any JS type, but when it is to be written to HTML (writeToDom == true) then it must be a string.
If this restriction is violated, a warning will be logged and nothing will be written to the DOM.</documentation>

        <property since="1.9.0" group="Data" defaultValue="false" type="sap.ui.core/boolean" name="writeToDom">
            <documentation>If set to &quot;true&quot; and the value is of type &quot;string&quot; and the key conforms to the documented restrictions, this custom data is written to the HTML root element of the control as a &quot;data-*&quot; attribute.
If the key is &quot;abc&quot; and the value is &quot;cde&quot;, the HTML will look as follows:
&amp;lt;SomeTag ... data-abc=&quot;cde&quot; ... &amp;gt;
Thus the application can provide stable attributes by data binding which can be used for styling or identification purposes.
ATTENTION: use carefully to not create huge attributes or a large number of them.</documentation>
