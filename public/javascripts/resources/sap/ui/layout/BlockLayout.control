    <documentation>The BlockLayout is used to display several objects in a section-based manner. It features horizontal and vertical subdivisions, and full-width banners seen frequently in contemporary web design. Background colors are attached directly to these “blocks” of the layout. Special full-width sections of the BlockLayout allow horizontal scrolling through a set of blocks.
Example use cases are SAP HANA Cloud Integration and the SAPUI5 Demo Kit. In SAP HANA Cloud Integration the BlockLayout serves as a banner-like presentation of illustrative icons with associated text. By placing pictorial and textual elements side by side in different blocks, a relation of content is established. In the SAPUI5 Demo Kit the BlockLayout serves as a flexible container for diverging content, such as headings, explanatory texts, code snippets, remarks, and examples.
The BlockLayout comes in three types: Layout only (default), Bright, and Mixed background colors.</documentation>
